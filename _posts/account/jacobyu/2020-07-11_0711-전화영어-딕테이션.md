딕테이션..

꾸준히하기 어렵네요.
스팀에다가 글을 올리면서 해봐야지..

opic questions

What do you and your family do to protect the environment?
How do you think our life is easier nowadays than it was in the past?
What technological device would you not like live without?


이게 ih questions이라니..
한국말로도 대답을 잘 못할것을 질문하네요.
평소에 이런걸 생각안하니까요.

선생님이 생각안나도 아무거라도 말해야된다고 ㅋㅋㅋ
