## Hunter's comment
Hi all,

I would like to introduce an actual robot that human can mount on.

### This amazing robot is called "Method-2".

It is a robot that is a manned robot developed by Korea Future Technology. 

The weight of this robot is **1.6** tons, and the height of the robot is **4.2** meters.


In 2017, it is the largest and heaviest among the manned robots.

Method-2 works in a way that follows the movement of the driver, as everyone has seen in many movies (Avatar, Pacific Rim)

In other words, the robot mimics how your hands and arms move.

The video below explains Method-2.

Many reporters, CEOs and scientists came to the company.

The Amazon president "Jeff Bezos" also came and mounted on the robot.

Jeff can be found in the video below.

I think you might wonder if this is a real robot.

However, Method-2 is a real robot and The company has been developing next version robot

I am looking forward to watching new robot "Method-3"

Thank you.
