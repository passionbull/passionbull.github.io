## Hunter's comment
Hello everyone!

I want to tell you about Google AIY Voicekit.

This kit helps you to build your own intelligent speaker such as Amazon echo, Google home.

With the Google Assistant built-in, build an intelligent speaker that can understand you, and respond when you ask it a question or tell it to do something. 

Let`s create your own projects that use voice recognition to control robots, music, games, and more.

There are some examples using Voicekit.
