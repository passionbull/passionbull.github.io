Hi, all

Have you ever created steem account for your friend?

It's pretty hard to introduce steemcoinpan to your friends or newbie. I think one of the hardest things to introduce about Steemit is explaination about master key and several keys. Several keys are high barriers to entry for people who are not familiar with blockchain. 

That's way I developed this tool. I want to make newbie come our steemcoinpan easily. I think creating account is simple with it.


* http://join.steemcoinpan.com/
* https://steem-account-creator-ui.herokuapp.com/

* Just give your friend this link (http://join.steemcoinpan.com/)
* Newbie can just set master key as he/she desired.
* It is free (Currently, this tool is using steemcoinpan stuff member account for creating accounts. Until ACT tokens are ran out, it is free.)
* Google signin is for checking who has already created an account or not.

#### Tutorial
it is old version tutorial. I added checking available account and multi language setting.
