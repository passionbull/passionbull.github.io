## Hunter's comment
Q.bo One is the perfect Open Source Platform for Developers.

It is based on Raspberry Pi and Arduino.

If you want to change boare, you can do it.

I think the greatest thnig on Q.bo One is that it make you focus on only software.

It includes belows sensors and motor, controller.
* eye - stereo camera
* mouth - dotmatrix led
* neck - servo motor x2
* ear - microphone with noise reductgion
* audio - speaker
* touch sensors
* connection - wifi, Bluetooth
 
So, you can focus on software.

I added video "Q.bo One Indiegogo Launch".
