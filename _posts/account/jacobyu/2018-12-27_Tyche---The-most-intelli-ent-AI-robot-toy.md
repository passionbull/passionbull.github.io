## Hunter's comment
Hi!

I wanna share with you a product named Tyche.

Tyche is an AI companion robot using a smartphone as its brain.

According to the website, Tyche has some features.

> * A conversational agent directed towards achieving true AI capabilities
> * Intelligent robot able to learn who the owner is through self disclosure.
> * Builds its own memory of events and conversations through multi-modal spatial sensory including audio and visual perceptions
> * Reasons and solves problems via planning based on the episodic memory built.

When I used Tyche, I was surprised that Tyche remembered what I said and answered questions based on robot memory.

I think Tyche is an affordable robot for giving children a chance to experience AI.


I added a video "Tyche AI Learning Robot for Kids".

Thank you.
